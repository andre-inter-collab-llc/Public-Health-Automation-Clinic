    "section": "3.1 Focus Areas",
    "text": "3.1 Focus Areas\nWhile the clinic accepts any public health automation problem, it is primarily oriented toward data management and analysis. This reflects where the greatest time savings tend to be found and where the tools are most mature.\n\n3.1.1 Data Management and Analysis\nThe core focus: automating the ingestion, cleaning, transformation, validation, and reporting of health data. Solutions are built primarily in R and Python, leveraging the open source ecosystem from Posit (the company behind RStudio, Quarto, Shiny, and related tools).\nTypical problems in this area include:\n\nExtracting structured data from PDFs, spreadsheets, or legacy exports\nCleaning and standardizing messy datasets\nAutomating recurring statistical analyses or surveillance reports\nBuilding reproducible analytic pipelines with R Markdown or Quarto\nCreating interactive dashboards with Shiny for local or team use\nData quality validation and exception reporting\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Business Process Analysis\nAutomation is not limited to epidemiological data. Public health programs also generate substantial overhead in project management, grant reporting, and operational tracking. These processes are equally amenable to scripting.\nFor example, one solution developed through this model used R scripts to generate custom project status reports from data exported by GanttProject, a free desktop project management tool. The script parsed the XML export, calculated milestone progress, and produced a formatted Quarto report, replacing a manual process that previously required assembling information from multiple sources each reporting cycle.\nOther business process examples include:\n\nAutomating grant milestone tracking from project management exports\nGenerating workload distribution reports from task management data\nConverting between file formats for cross-agency data exchange\nBatch file renaming and organization based on consistent conventions\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Local-First Philosophy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantLocal-First Tools\n\n\n\nThe clinic prioritizes solutions that run on your computer or local server. A script you can execute on your own machine is more reliable, efficient, and sustainable than a workflow that depends on a cloud-based large language model.\nAI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and similar) may be used in the development and documentation of solutions, but the solutions themselves will not require AI or LLM access to run. A well-written R or Python script that processes 50,000 records deterministically on your laptop will always be more dependable than sending that data to a remote API.\nWhen AI-based approaches are genuinely the best fit for a problem, they will be noted as an option, but they are never the default recommendation.",

    "section": "3.2 The Initiative",
    "text": "3.2 The Initiative\nThe Public Health Automation Clinic is a free, community-driven service offered through Intersect Collaborations. The concept is simple:\n\nYou describe a problem. A repetitive, tedious, or error-prone task that consumes your time.\nWe develop a solution. An R or Python script, Shiny app, tool recommendation, or workflow that automates or streamlines the task.\nWe publish it. All solutions are made publicly available as anonymized, generic resources so that anyone facing a similar problem can benefit.\n\nThis is not consulting. There are no contracts, no invoices, no deliverable timelines for the free service. Submissions are reviewed and addressed as time and capacity allow. The goal is to build a growing library of practical, reusable automation solutions for the public health workforce.\nYou may submit anonymously through the intake form. Your specific details are never published; solutions are generalized so they are useful to people doing similar tasks across different teams, agencies, and fields.\n\n3.2.1 What Qualifies\nThe clinic focuses on tasks that meet these criteria:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nRepetitive\nThe task is performed regularly (daily, weekly, monthly, per reporting cycle)\n\n\nManual\nThe task currently requires significant hands-on effort\n\n\nDefinable\nThe task can be described with clear inputs, steps, and expected outputs\n\n\nRealistic\nA solution can be built with commonly available tools (R, Python, Posit tools, Microsoft Office, open source software)\n\n\nGeneralizable\nThe solution, once anonymized, could help people doing similar tasks outside your specific team or field\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1.1 Examples of Good Submissions\nA well-structured submission describes the context, the role, and what needs to happen using clear requirement-style language. Standard User Stories, Given-Person-Should (GPS), and Situational Protocol formats all work well:\nUser Story Format (As a [role], I want [action], so that [outcome]):\n\n“As an epidemiologist, I want to automatically extract patient demographics from 200 monthly PDF lab reports into a single spreadsheet, so that I can eliminate 8 hours of manual data entry and transcription errors.”\n“As a data analyst, I want to geocode 5,000 addresses using free tools without ArcGIS, so that I can produce maps for a community health assessment on a limited budget.”\n\nGPS Format (Given [context], the [role] should [action] to [outcome]):\n\n“Given a surveillance system export that produces cryptic filenames (e.g., RPT_20260115_0847_A3F2.pdf), the registrar should be able to batch-rename all files to the convention [PatientID]_[FacilityCode]_[ReportDate].pdf, to enable rapid file retrieval and consistent record-keeping.”\n\nSituational Protocol Format (When [trigger], the [process/system] shall [action] within [constraint]):\n\n“When the quarterly reporting cycle begins, the analyst’s workflow shall merge incidence data from three Excel workbooks into a summary template automatically, because the structure is identical every quarter and the current manual copy-paste process takes a full day.”\n“When a new registry extract is received, the data quality process shall check all 15 edit rules (e.g., diagnosis date precedes treatment date, age between 0 and 120) and generate an exception report, because these rules never change and manual checking is error-prone.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWriting a Good Submission\n\n\n\nYou do not need to use these exact formats. But the more clearly you describe the context (what triggers the task), the role (who performs it), the current process (what you do now), and the desired outcome (what the result should look like), the faster we can develop a useful solution.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1.2 Examples of Tasks Outside Scope\n\nBuilding a full web application or database system\nTasks requiring access to proprietary or classified systems\nWork that requires domain-specific clinical judgment (e.g., case adjudication)\nIntegration with systems that require vendor coordination\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 How It Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Submit Intake Form] --&gt; B[Review & Triage]\n    B --&gt; C{Feasible?}\n    C --&gt;|Yes| D[Develop Solution]\n    C --&gt;|Needs Info| E[Follow Up]\n    C --&gt;|Out of Scope| F[Provide Guidance]\n    E --&gt; B\n    D --&gt; G[Test & Document]\n    G --&gt; H[Anonymize & Generalize]\n    H --&gt; I[Publish to Library]\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Public Health Automation Clinic Workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Submit Your Problem\nComplete the Public Health Automation Clinic Intake Form describing your problem (anonymous submissions welcome), or open a GitHub Issue to share your problem publicly. The more detail you provide, the faster and more accurately we can develop a solution.\nStep 2: Review and Triage\nSubmissions are reviewed based on feasibility, impact (how many people face this problem), and clarity of the description. Problems that are well-defined and broadly applicable are prioritized.\nStep 3: Solution Development\nSolutions are developed using free and open source tools, with a strong preference for R, Python, and the Posit ecosystem (RStudio, Quarto, Shiny). Typical deliverables include:\n\nR or Python scripts with documentation and usage instructions\nQuarto documents or R Markdown reports that automate recurring analyses and produce formatted output\nR Shiny web applications for interactive tools (code provided; hosting is not included)\nTool recommendations with setup guides for existing open source software\nWorkflow redesigns using commonly available tools (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.)\nStep-by-step guides for configuring software to automate a task\n\nAll solutions are designed to run locally on your computer. They do not require cloud AI services or LLM access.\nStep 4: Anonymize, Generalize, and Publish\nAll solutions are anonymized and generalized before being published to the shared library. No submission-specific details, organization names, or identifying information are included. The goal is to produce solutions that are useful to anyone facing a similar problem, regardless of their specific team or field.\n\n\n3.2.3 What You Will Need to Provide\nThe intake form captures the information necessary to develop a practical solution:\n\nThe Problem: What task are you trying to automate? What makes it tedious or error-prone?\nCurrent Workflow: How do you currently perform this task? What are the steps?\nVolume and Frequency: How often do you do this? How many records, files, or items are involved?\nTools Available: What software do you have access to? (R/RStudio, Python, Quarto, Microsoft Office, Google Workspace, etc.)\nTechnical Environment: Can you install software on your machine, or do you need IT administrator approval?\nSample Data: Can you point us to a publicly available dataset or file that resembles your data? (See the note below on sharing examples.)\nContact Preference: Anonymous submission, or would you like follow-up?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSharing Example Data\n\n\n\nTo help us understand your problem, find a publicly available dataset or file online that resembles the structure of your data. This could be a sample dataset from a government open data portal, a dataset on Kaggle, a CDC data download, or any publicly accessible file. Paste the URL in the intake form.\nDo not upload or share your actual data, even if de-identified. Linking to a public example keeps your submission anonymous and avoids any risk of exposing sensitive information. If no public example exists, describe the data structure in your problem description (column names, data types, number of rows, file format).\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Setting Expectations\nThe Automation Clinic in its free form is a personal project, developed between paid engagements. I have benefitted tremendously from open source tools and communities throughout my career, and this initiative is my way of giving back to the public health workforce.\nThis means the free service has real limitations, and it is important to be transparent about them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFree Service Guidelines\n\n\n\n\nNo guaranteed timelines. Submissions are addressed as capacity allows. This is a one-person effort run alongside paid consulting work.\nNo guaranteed solutions. Some problems may be outside scope or require more context than can be provided through a form.\nNo ongoing updates or maintenance. Solutions from the free service are provided as a snapshot: a working script or tool delivered at a point in time. If your workflows evolve, your data formats change, or you need iterative refinement, the free service cannot guarantee follow-up development. Solutions are designed to be modular and well-documented so that someone with basic R or Python familiarity can adapt them independently, but sustained maintenance and updates for a specific organization’s needs fall under paid consulting.\nSolutions use free, local-first tools. We prioritize R, Python, and the Posit ecosystem (RStudio, Quarto, Shiny). Solutions run on your computer and do not require cloud AI services. We will not develop solutions that require purchasing commercial software.\nAll solutions are published. Solutions from the free service are anonymized, generalized, and made publicly available. If you need a private, organization-specific solution, that falls under paid consulting.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Paid Services for Urgent or Evolving Needs\nIf you have a task that is time-sensitive, requires dedicated attention, needs ongoing updates as workflows evolve, or involves more complex integration work, Intersect Collaborations offers paid consulting services. Paid engagements include:\n\nPriority development with agreed-upon timelines\nCustom solutions tailored to your specific environment and systems\nOngoing support, maintenance, and iterative updates as your needs evolve\nPrivate deliverables that remain confidential to your organization (unlike the free service, where all solutions are published)\nTraining for your team to maintain and extend the solution\n\nOne thing I hope to build into paid engagements: where clients are willing, the generalizable portions of the work (anonymized, with no organization-specific details) would be published to the public library so that others facing similar problems can benefit. This is entirely at the client’s discretion, but it is how the free and paid sides of this initiative can reinforce each other and grow the shared resource over time.\nFor those interested in getting started with automation, Intersect Collaborations also offers a training course: “Automating Public Health Analytics with R, Quarto, and Windows Tools.” The course is designed to help public health professionals automate basic tasks and build the background, skills, and familiarity with tools needed to get the most out of the solutions the clinic provides. It is not a prerequisite for submitting to or using the clinic, but it can help participants hit the ground running when applying solutions to their own workflows.\nTo inquire about paid services or training, contact André van Zyl directly through the Intersect Collaborations website or LinkedIn.",

    "text": "3.3 The Automation Mindset\nSubmitting a problem to the clinic is valuable even if the solution is simple. The act of describing a manual process in structured terms is itself the first step toward optimization. The optimization hierarchy applies here:\n\nCan the task be eliminated? Sometimes the answer is yes, and the submission process reveals it.\nCan it be automated? Most submissions fall here: a script, a tool, a macro.\nCan it be standardized? Even if full automation is not feasible, documenting the process reduces variability and training time.\n\n\n3.3.1 Automation and Workforce Identity\nA concern that deserves honest acknowledgment: some people’s entire job descriptions are built around the manual processes that automation would replace. That is a real and uncomfortable tension.\nAutomating a task is straightforward. Rethinking someone’s role so they can contribute at a higher level is a much harder organizational problem, one that requires leadership willing to invest in retraining and redesigning positions rather than simply eliminating them.\nThe vision behind this initiative is not fewer people. It is the same people doing more meaningful work: interpreting data instead of copying it, investigating outbreaks instead of renaming files, designing surveillance strategies instead of reformatting spreadsheets. But that only happens if organizations commit to the transition, not just the tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantWhere Automation Fits in the Bigger Picture\n\n\n\nAutomation is the medium-term fix for public health professionals stuck in inefficient systems. It addresses the immediate pain: scripts and pipelines that eliminate mechanical tasks and free people to think.\nBut the long-term answer is architecture. Interoperability standards like HL7 and FHIR aim to make data move between systems without manual translation, but the technology alone is not enough. The true barriers to integration often include governance, funding silos, and misaligned incentives. And critically, we must rethink how we educate and prepare public health professionals for this landscape.\nThis book focuses on the practical, immediate wins. The broader vision of systems architecture, interoperability, and workforce education is explored in the companion resource, Bridgeframe: Bridging Business Analysis and Public Health.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Building a Community of Practice\nThe long-term vision for the Automation Clinic extends beyond individual problem-solving. Each submission and solution contributes to:\n\nA pattern library of common public health automation needs\nReusable code templates that can be adapted across jurisdictions\nWorkforce development by demonstrating what is possible with accessible tools\nA feedback loop that identifies the most impactful areas for tool development\n\nPublic health professionals who have solved their own automation challenges are encouraged to share those solutions as well. The clinic is not a one-way service; it is a community resource.\nThe solution library is available as a public GitHub repository. Contributors can submit their own solutions, suggest improvements to existing ones, and help build the library beyond what any single person could produce. You can also use GitHub Issues to share problems, suggestions, or solutions directly (note that GitHub Issues are public and not anonymous).",

Registrars manually renamed each file to follow the convention [PatientID]_[FacilityCode]_[ReportDate].pdf. An R script using string parsing and file system operations eliminated this entirely.\nData quality checks: Fifteen edit rules (e.g., “diagnosis date must precede treatment date,” “age at diagnosis must be between 0 and 120”) were checked manually in Excel. A Python script with pandas automated all checks and generated an exception report in under two seconds.\nQuarterly report assembly: Data from three source workbooks was manually copied into a summary template. An R Markdown script automated the extraction, transformation, and report generation, reducing a full-day task to a five-minute execution.\nProject status reporting: The registry director tracked milestones in GanttProject. An R script parsed the GanttProject XML export, calculated completion rates by program area, and generated a formatted Quarto report for the monthly steering committee, replacing a half-day of manual slide preparation.\n\nEach of these solutions required less than a day to develop and saved the registry team dozens of hours per quarter.",

If the task has clear inputs, defined steps, and predictable outputs, a script or tool can likely handle it. This is where most automation wins are found.\nCan it be standardized?

That is a real and uncomfortable tension.\nAutomating a task is straightforward. Rethinking someone’s role so they can contribute at a higher level is a much harder organizational problem, one that requires leadership willing to invest in retraining and redesigning positions rather than simply eliminating them.\nThe vision behind this initiative is not fewer people. It is the same people doing more meaningful work: interpreting data instead of copying it, investigating outbreaks instead of renaming files, designing surveillance strategies instead of reformatting spreadsheets. But that only happens if organizations commit to the transition, not just the tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipFraming Automation for Your Team\n\n\n\nWhen introducing automation to colleagues or leadership, frame it in terms of time recovered, not tasks eliminated. “This script saves 8 hours per month that can be redirected to case investigation” is more effective than “This script replaces what someone currently does.”",

    "text": "14.1 The Core Commitment\nThe Public Health Automation Clinic uses AI tools to rapidly develop solutions that public health professionals can run deterministically on a local computer or server, without needing any AI tools going forward. Every script, template, and workflow published in this book runs locally on standard hardware using open source tools. No AI subscription, cloud API, or large language model is required to execute any solution.\nAI accelerates the authoring and development process; it does not become a dependency for the end user.\nThe solutions developed here are based on real experience and real needs in the field of public health. AI coding tools are used to package and refine that expertise into working, well-documented code. The domain knowledge, problem framing, and quality standards come from years of applied work in epidemiology and public health informatics.\nThis distinction matters. Many public health agencies still prohibit staff from using AI tools directly. Because every solution published here is openly available as standard R or Python code, professionals in those agencies can use the outputs without any AI involvement. The code is public, inspectable, and runs entirely on your machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantAI Builds It; You Own It\n\n\n\nThe solutions in this book are designed to be fully transparent, fully local, and fully independent of AI once delivered. If you can run R or Python on your machine, you can run every solution published here. All software required to access or use this resource is free and open source.",

The local-first design ensures that adopting these tools introduces no new data-sharing risks.\nAll software needed to run the solutions (R, Python, RStudio, Quarto, and their dependencies) is free, open source, and installable without cloud accounts or subscription services.",

    "section": "14.3 Sustainability and Reliability",
    "text": "14.3 Sustainability and Reliability\nA deterministic script or rule that runs reliably on a local device is far more sustainable and reliable than having a large language model process data in the cloud. Cloud-based AI introduces dependencies on network availability, API pricing, rate limits, model versioning, and third-party data handling policies. Any of these can change without notice, breaking workflows that public health teams depend on. LLMs and generative AI also require an enormous amount of compute to generate content and code, far more than most laptops can provide. That computational cost is ongoing every time the model is invoked, making it an impractical foundation for routine, recurring tasks.\nA local R or Python script, by contrast, produces the same output every time it runs against the same input. It does not require an internet connection. It does not incur per-query costs. It does not change behavior because a model was updated. It can be version-controlled, tested, audited, and handed to a colleague who can run it years later with predictable results.\nThat said, it is clear that LLMs are often better than most humans at writing that initial deterministic code. AI excels at rapidly scaffolding scripts, translating requirements into working functions, and generating boilerplate that would take a developer much longer to write from scratch. The key insight is to use AI where it is strongest (generating code quickly) and then deploy the result where deterministic tools are strongest (running reliably, locally, indefinitely).\nThis is the model the Automation Clinic follows: AI accelerates the development of solutions that, once delivered, are entirely self-sufficient.",

All examples are anonymized and generalized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteA Practical View of AI in Development\n\n\n\nUsing AI to build automation tools for public health is analogous to using a calculator for arithmetic. The calculator does not replace the understanding of what to calculate or why; it accelerates the mechanical work. Similarly, AI accelerates the writing of scripts and documentation while the public health logic, context, and quality standards remain human responsibilities.",

    "section": "14.9 Authorship and AI",
    "text": "14.9 Authorship and AI\nAI raises legitimate questions about authorship, and this project takes those questions seriously. The guiding principles are straightforward:\n\nIs the intent helpful? Every use of AI in this project serves the goal of advancing public health practice.\nAm I the author? The intellectual work (problem identification, solution design, domain context, quality review) is mine. AI assists with drafting, editing, and code generation, but those contributions do not constitute authorship.\nDoes the output reflect my thinking? My drafts, original code, and ideas are the starting points. AI refines and extends that work under my direction. Code is only used if I understand it and have tested it.\n\nThis project follows the ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors) authorship guidelines. Under those guidelines, authorship requires all four criteria: substantial contributions to conception or design; drafting the work or critically revising it; final approval of the version to be published; and accountability for accuracy and integrity. AI cannot meet these criteria because it cannot take responsibility for the accuracy, integrity, or originality of the work (ICMJE Section II.A.4). The tasks AI performs here (writing assistance, editing, proofreading, code scaffolding) are specifically listed by the ICMJE as activities that alone do not qualify a contributor for authorship (Section II.A.3).\nAs the ICMJE further notes, AI can generate authoritative-sounding output that is incorrect, incomplete, or biased. Every AI-generated contribution in this project is carefully reviewed, tested, and edited before inclusion. The author takes full responsibility, understands the work deeply, and ensures it reflects professional judgment grounded in public health domain expertise.\nIn the spirit of full transparency and disclosure, the entire development history of this project is publicly available at the Public Health Automation Clinic GitHub repository. Every commit, every change, and every contribution is visible and inspectable. This openness allows anyone to verify how the resource was built, what role AI played, and how human judgment shaped the final product.\nAI is useful for preliminary research, but it cannot be trusted to be systematic or reproducible in the way that scientific work demands. The structured approach, the verification, and the domain-specific validation remain human responsibilities.\n\n14.9.1 Your Authorship of Your Outputs\nThe same principle applies to professionals who use these tools in their own work. When you take a script from this library, adapt it to your data, run it, and produce a report or analysis, you are the author of that output. You are responsible for verifying the results, understanding the logic, and ensuring the output is appropriate for your context.\nThe tools published here are instruments. Authorship belongs to the person who wields them with intent and accountability.\n\n\n14.9.2 Citing This Resource\nIf the Public Health Automation Clinic has been useful in your work, please consider citing it. A citation helps others discover the resource and supports the community of practice this project aims to build.\n\nAndré van Zyl, Public Health Automation Clinic, Intersect Collaborations LLC, 2025.
