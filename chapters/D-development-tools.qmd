# Development Tools and AI Transparency

This appendix documents the tools used to build and maintain the Public Health Automation Clinic, including the role of AI in its development. Transparency about how this resource is created is central to the clinic's values.

## The Core Commitment

The Public Health Automation Clinic uses AI tools to **rapidly develop solutions** that public health professionals can **use without AI**. Every script, template, and workflow published in this book runs locally on standard hardware using open source tools. No AI subscription, cloud API, or large language model is required to execute any solution.

AI accelerates the *authoring and development process*; it does not become a dependency for the *end user*.

::: {.callout-important title="AI Builds It; You Own It"}
The solutions in this book are designed to be fully transparent, fully local, and fully independent of AI once delivered. If you can run R or Python on your machine, you can run every solution published here.

## Technology Stack

The following tools are used to build and maintain this book and develop its solutions:

| Tool | Purpose | Details |
|:-----|:--------|:--------|
| **[Quarto](https://quarto.org/)** | Document publishing system | Renders the book to HTML for GitHub Pages |
| **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** | Code editor | Primary development environment |
| **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)** | AI-assisted development | Content drafting, code generation, editing |
| **[Git](https://git-scm.com/) / [GitHub](https://github.com/)** | Version control and hosting | Source code management and public repository |
| **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)** | Automated publishing | Deploys book to GitHub Pages on push to `main` |
| **[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)** | Diagram generation | Workflow and process diagrams (built into Quarto) |
| **[R](https://www.r-project.org/) / [Python](https://www.python.org/)** | Solution development | Core languages for automation solutions |

## AI-Assisted Development

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is used throughout the development of this book and its solutions for:

- **Content development**: Drafting, structuring, and refining chapter content and instructional material
- **Code generation**: Writing R and Python scripts, Mermaid diagrams, and configuration files
- **Problem translation**: Converting vague workflow descriptions into structured automation specifications
- **Quality review**: Checking consistency across chapters, identifying gaps, and improving clarity
- **Rapid prototyping**: Quickly producing working solution drafts that are then reviewed and refined

### LLM Models Used

GitHub Copilot provides access to multiple large language models during development:

| Provider | Models | Primary Use |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
| **[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)** | Claude (Sonnet, Opus) | Complex analysis, long-form content development |
| **[Google](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/)** | Gemini | Research, cross-referencing, fact-checking |
| **[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)** | GPT-4, GPT-4o | Code generation, quick edits, formatting |

### Copilot Features Used

- **Chat**: Interactive development sessions for complex content and solution design
- **Inline suggestions**: Real-time code and prose completion during editing
- **Agent mode**: Multi-step tasks including file creation, refactoring, and terminal operations

### Deep Research Tools

Extended research and analysis is supported by deep research capabilities in:

- **[Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)**: Literature review, public health context research, and tool landscape analysis
- **[OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)**: Deep research mode for exploring automation patterns, public health data standards, and implementation approaches

These tools complement GitHub Copilot by providing broader research context beyond the immediate codebase.

### Project Context for AI

A detailed project context file (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) provides Copilot with specifics about the repository, including:

- Book structure and chapter organization
- Content style guidelines and deduplication rules
- Public health terminology and conventions
- Privacy rules (e.g., keeping `communications/` content local-only)
- Branding and formatting standards

This context file ensures that AI-generated contributions are consistent with the book's voice, scope, and technical standards.

## Why This Transparency Matters

Public health professionals deserve to know how the tools they rely on are built. AI-assisted development raises legitimate questions:

- **Can I trust the output?** Every solution is reviewed for correctness before publication. AI drafts are starting points, not final products.
- **Will I need AI to use this?** No. Solutions are standard R and Python scripts. They require no AI tools to execute.
- **Is the content original?** AI assists with drafting and refinement, but the domain expertise, problem framing, and quality assurance come from the author's experience in public health informatics and epidemiology.
- **What about data privacy?** No real patient data, protected health information, or identifiable submission details are shared with AI tools. All examples are anonymized and generalized.

::: {.callout-note title="A Practical View of AI in Development"}
Using AI to build automation tools for public health is analogous to using a calculator for arithmetic. The calculator does not replace the understanding of what to calculate or why; it accelerates the mechanical work. Similarly, AI accelerates the writing of scripts and documentation while the public health logic, context, and quality standards remain human responsibilities.
:::

## What AI Does Not Replace

AI tools are powerful accelerators, but they do not replace:

- **Domain expertise**: Understanding which public health workflows need automation, and why, requires years of field experience
- **Problem framing**: Translating a vague "this takes too long" into a clear automation specification is a human skill
- **Quality assurance**: Every script must be tested against realistic data and edge cases
- **Ethical judgment**: Decisions about data privacy, anonymization, and appropriate use require human oversight
- **Community relationships**: Building trust with submitters and understanding their real working conditions cannot be automated

## Local Development Setup

For contributors who want to modify or extend this book:

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Quarto**: Download from [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
2. **Install VS Code**: Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. **Install Git**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
4. **Install the Quarto VS Code Extension**: Search "Quarto" in VS Code extensions

### Clone and Preview

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andre-inter-collab-llc/Public-Health-Automation-Clinic.git
cd Public-Health-Automation-Clinic
quarto preview
```

This starts a local server and opens the book in your browser. Changes to `.qmd` files automatically refresh.

### Render the Book

```bash
quarto render
```

Output is generated in the `_site/` directory.
