# Data Cleaning and Transformation

Standardizing messy datasets, deduplication, edit rule validation, and exception reporting. These solutions turn raw data into analysis-ready inputs.

::: {.callout-note title="Published Solutions"}
The following solutions have been developed through the clinic. Additional solutions will be added as they are completed.

- [Combine and Compare Spreadsheets](04a-combine-compare-spreadsheets.qmd): a Shiny app for merging multiple Excel/CSV files and detecting column structure differences

## What Belongs Here

Solutions in this part address tasks involving data preparation and quality:

- **Data standardization** to normalize inconsistent formats, codes, or naming conventions across sources
- **Deduplication** using deterministic or probabilistic matching to identify and resolve duplicate records
- **Edit rule validation** to automatically check data against defined business rules (e.g., diagnosis date precedes treatment date, age within valid range)
- **Exception reporting** to flag records that fail validation checks and generate actionable reports
- **Data reshaping** to pivot, merge, split, or restructure datasets for downstream analysis
- **Missing data handling** with standardized imputation or flagging strategies
- **Geocoding and address standardization** using free tools to prepare location data for mapping
