# Data Analysis and Reporting

Recurring surveillance analyses, reproducible reports with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and R Markdown, interactive dashboards with [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/), and automated chart and table generation. These solutions turn analysis-ready data into actionable outputs.

## What Belongs Here

Solutions in this part address tasks involving analysis and output generation:

- **Recurring surveillance reports** automated with parameterized Quarto or R Markdown documents
- **Automated chart and table generation** for standard epidemiological outputs (incidence tables, trend charts, demographic breakdowns)
- **Interactive dashboards** built with R Shiny for local or team use (code provided; hosting is not included)
- **Parameterized report templates** that generate jurisdiction-specific or time-period-specific outputs from a single script
- **Automated data visualization** pipelines using ggplot2, Plotly, or similar tools
- **Spatial analysis and mapping** using [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) or R spatial packages for geographic health data
