# Submission Templates and Examples

This appendix provides detailed templates and worked examples for the three submission formats accepted by the Automation Clinic. Use whichever format feels most natural; the goal is to clearly communicate the problem, not to follow a rigid structure.

## User Story Format

**Template**: As a [role], I want [action], so that [outcome].

### Worked Examples

> "As an epidemiologist, I want to automatically extract patient demographics from 200 monthly PDF lab reports into a single spreadsheet, so that I can eliminate 8 hours of manual data entry and transcription errors."

> "As a data analyst, I want to geocode 5,000 addresses using free tools without ArcGIS, so that I can produce maps for a community health assessment on a limited budget."

> "As a program manager, I want to generate a weekly summary of task completion rates from our project tracking spreadsheet, so that I can report progress to the steering committee without manually compiling data from multiple tabs."

## GPS Format (Given-Person-Should)

**Template**: Given [context], the [role] should [action] to [outcome].

### Worked Examples

> "Given a surveillance system export that produces cryptic filenames (e.g., `RPT_20260115_0847_A3F2.pdf`), the registrar should be able to batch-rename all files to the convention `[PatientID]_[FacilityCode]_[ReportDate].pdf`, to enable rapid file retrieval and consistent record-keeping."

> "Given a monthly data extract from the state vital records system in fixed-width text format, the analyst should be able to automatically convert and load the data into a standardized CSV with proper column headers, to eliminate manual reformatting before analysis."

## Situational Protocol Format

**Template**: When [trigger], the [process/system] shall [action] within [constraint].

### Worked Examples

> "When the quarterly reporting cycle begins, the analyst's workflow shall merge incidence data from three Excel workbooks into a summary template automatically, because the structure is identical every quarter and the current manual copy-paste process takes a full day."

> "When a new registry extract is received, the data quality process shall check all 15 edit rules (e.g., diagnosis date precedes treatment date, age between 0 and 120) and generate an exception report, because these rules never change and manual checking is error-prone."

## Tips for Any Format

Regardless of format, the most useful submissions clearly describe:

- **Context**: What triggers the task? What system or data source is involved?
- **Role**: Who performs this task? What is their expertise level?
- **Current process**: What steps do you follow today? How long does it take?
- **Desired outcome**: What should the result look like? What format, structure, or output do you need?
- **Volume and frequency**: How many records, files, or items? How often?
