# Desktop Automation

File renaming, format conversion, directory organization, and batch operations on local files. This is the starting point for most automation journeys: taking control of the files and folders on your own computer.

::: {.callout-note title="Solutions Coming Soon"}
This part of the book will be populated as solutions are developed through the [Automation Clinic intake process](01-automation-intake.qmd). Each solution will be published as a subchapter below.
